# About-Me
Description about myself

Hi everyone!

My name is Joshua Hussong and I am currently a full-time data analyst at Oak Street Health. I am currently in a part-time master's of Business Analytics program at UCSD's Rady School of Management. After I graduate I hope to pursue a career in product management that allows me to utilize my advanced technological skillset, as well as my expertise in leadership and business coursework from my master's program.

I enjoy working on personal projects, particularly on Kaggle, and anything that I work more extensively on I move into my Github. I currently am proficient in SQL, Python, R, and Tableau and am currently learning more advanced statistical methods as well as machine learning modeling techniques. 

In my free time I enjoy working out, playing video games, and am currently attempting to learn how to play guitar. 

My favorite books are the Harry Potter series, and I love spending my afternoons reading books in the sun.
